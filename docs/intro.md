## Why ts-numbers?

ts-numbers is designed to solve the complex problem of number formatting and input handling in web applications. It provides a consistent and powerful API for handling numeric values with the following benefits:

- **Type Safety**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript for excellent type safety
- **Lightweight**: Small bundle size with no external dependencies
- **Comprehensive**: Handles a wide range of number formatting needs
- **Flexible**: Works with any HTML input element or element that can display text
- **Extensible**: Easy to customize and extend with your own formatting rules
- **Well-tested**: Extensive test coverage for reliability

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { Numbers } from 'ts-numbers'

// Basic currency formatting
const price = new Numbers('#price-input', {
  currencySymbol: '$',
  decimalPlaces: 2,
  digitGroupSeparator: ',',
})

// Set a value programmatically
price.set(1234.56) // Displays as "$1,234.56"

// Get the raw numeric value
const value = price.getNumber() // 1234.56
```
